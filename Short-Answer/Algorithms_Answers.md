#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(1). Even though this is a loop we will only go thru it twice which is constant O(2) we drop the constant with big O meaning O(1) time. We can set N to any number and n*n*n will be equal to 2 run thrus or (a+n*n) + (a+n*n) == n*n*n

b) O(n log n) the first loop iterates thru all of n making it O(n). The second loop is shorter as j grows at a faster rate then n. O(n) \* O(log n) == O(n log n)

c)
